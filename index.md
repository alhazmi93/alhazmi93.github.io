I am Qisthi Alhazmi Hidayaturrohman. I have dedicated myself to academics and research since 2018. I earned a Master's in Telecommunication Electronics from Gunadarma University in 2015.

My research areas include the Internet of Things technology, data analytics, predictive analytics, and health informatics.

I am a doctoral student in the Department of Information Science and Engineering at Saga University, Japan, and will graduate in September 2026. My research topic concerns machine learning-based predictive analytics in health/medical applications.

I am actively looking for a full-time post-doc or assistant professor opportunity in applied data science, medical/health informatics, or Internet of Things implementation in medical applications.
